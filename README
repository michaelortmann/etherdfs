Description:

  EtherDFS (The Ethernet DOS File System) is an 'installable filesystem' TSR for
  DOS. It maps a drive from a remote computer (typically Freebsd or Linux based)
  to a local drive letter, using raw ethernet frames to communicate.

  This is version 0.8.2 from http://etherdfs.sourceforge.net plus reduced
  EtherDFS resident footprint and some other patches by me.
